# Toddle Backned assessment

A stateless microservice with some api endpoints made using Nodejs , express and jwt

## Installation

Download the file

```bash
  npm Install
```

If there is a error after running npm install try deleting package-lock.json
and again run

```bash
  npm Install
```
Make change to the secret key in .env file according to your need , you can generate a secure key by
using 


```bash
  npm run generate
```

#### Any changes made in .env file will affect the whole code , so untill and unless you don't want to manually change the token in every api request I suggest you to not change

To run 

```bash
  npm start
```

    
## Deployment

if you don't want to go through the boring process of above installation you can directly test my api using the below button , the only thing you need is an postman account .
